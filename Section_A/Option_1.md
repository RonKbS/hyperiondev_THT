### OPTION 1
Hello {hypothetical_student_name},  
It's a great effort you've made, coming up with this solution.  
There are a few things I would like to recommend so you can take your next step as a professional programmer;
- Correctness
    - Python takes _**indentation**_ very seriously, so always ensure that the different blocks of code are properly indented. Within a function, they should be an extra 2-spaces/tab further. You can read up on it [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_indentation.asp). Also, you can use an [IDE](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/middleware/what-is-ide) like VS Code or Pycharm.  
    If I've been rambling on yet you already know all thisðŸ˜„, then ensure to go through your code at least once, after you've pasted it into the submission box.
    - _**Dotting the i-s and crossing the t-s.**_ One _i_ was missed on line 5 and to ensure it rarely happens, _do_ go through your code.
- Efficiency
    - The code written has an O(n) time efficiency and cheers to that! You _can_ achieve the same results with less lines, using groupby from itertools. It may not be as time efficient ([timeit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html)), but the less lines of code you have to write and review, the less that bugs are likely to occur.
- Style
    - Your code is relatively readable and I applaud you for it. Have you heard of Python's [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide? It's how we ensure any other Python programmer will easily be able to read your code even more easily. Some tips you'll find in there;
        1. Ensure a blank line exist between any functions you write.
        2. Use short names like *sub_str* instead of _i_.  
    - Also, IDEs have the great ability of installing extensions that you can use to ensure your styling is following industry standards.
- Documentation
    - This was another _i_ not crossed, metaphorically speaking. Docstrings and comments are of great help to you when you eventually come back to a piece of code you've written. So having some (even in functions as simple as this) will be of great help to future {hypothetical_student_name}.  

Overall, you have a great future ahead and the quizzes on this platform are bound to help you immensely, so keep goingðŸ’ª!
